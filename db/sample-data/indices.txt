# B+-Tree

Internal and leaf nodes fit within memory, which we want.

- Binary search can be done within memory

Pointer from one leaf node to the next sequentially

- Note primary key is an ID
- Secondary index is the name
- “Find each item sequentially in the database”

## Queries on B+ Trees

---

Find record with search-key value *V*.

1. ********C = root********
2. while *C* is not a leaf node
    1. i = least value such that V ≤ Ki
    2. if no such value i exists, set C = last non-null pointer in C
    3. else (V = Ki) ? C = Pi+1, otherwise C= Pi
3. i = least value Ki = V
4. If i exists, follow pointer Pi to desired record
5. Otherwise no record with search-key value *k* exists
