Ecologists generally consider systems to be closed—but that’s definitely not true. Ex. pond ecosystem: Weather/Climate Energy (light and chemical $C_6H_{12}O_6$) Runoff—nutrients and toxins Other organisms might exist (migration, humans) Evaporation Abiotic factors in biomes Open Ocean light nutrient content and salinity Coral reef light turbidity (clearness of water) depth (max. 15m) Tropical Rainforests rain soil acidic and not nutrient-dense Mangrove varying salinity roots providing habitat and other ecosystem services (abiotic-adjacent) latitude Estuary varying salinity
